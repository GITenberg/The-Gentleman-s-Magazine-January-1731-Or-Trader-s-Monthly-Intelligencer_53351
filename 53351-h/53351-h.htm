<h2><i>A View of the <span class="smcap">Weekly ESSAYS</span> in this Month.</i></h2>

<h3><i>The <span class="blackletter">Craftsman</span></i>, <i>by</i> Caleb D’anvers <i>Esq;</i>
and Mr <i>Oldcastle</i>. Jan. 2. No. 235.</h3>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-m.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Mr. <i>Oldcastle</i> having
begun his remarks
on the conduct of
the Kings of <i>England</i>,
to shew how
the spirit of <i>Faction</i>,
and the spirit of <i>Liberty</i>
had exerted themselves at different
times and occasions, had brought
his Observations down to the reign of
Q. <i>Elizabeth</i>. He begins No. 234,
with an Eulogium upon her prudent
conduct in the most arduous difficulties
that attended her accession to
the Throne. These difficulties he explains
at large, and goes on No. 235,
to speak more largely of the means
whereby she establish’d her glory and
confirm’d herself in the affections of
her People. Her first principle was to
be neither <i>fear’d nor despis’d</i> by those
she govern’d. He mentions some instances
wherein she discover’d her wisdom
in both these respects, particularly
in maintaining her <i>Prerogative</i>,
which altho’ she was fond of, yet took
care it never should be grievous, or if
it should happen so to particular persons,
that it should appear specious to
the publick. The effects, he says, of
a bare-fac’d <i>Prerogative</i> are not so dangerous
to <i>Liberty</i> as the attempts which
are made to surprize and undermine it.
Wherefore Q. <i>Eliz.</i> never kept up a
<i>Standing Army</i>, but placed her security
in the affection of her People. With
respect to <i>parties</i> he extols her moderation
and equity, by which conduct she
stood on firmer ground, and had less
to fear from the spirit of <i>Faction</i>. She
neither hastily espoused the party
which she favour’d, nor inflam’d the
spirits of the adverse party. The <i>Papists</i>
and <i>Puritans</i> she used with lenity, ’till
their evil practices made it necessary
to execute rigours, and even then she
distinguished <i>Papists in conscience from
Papists in Faction, nor condemn’d the
Zeal of the Puritans, but sometimes censured
their Violence. He says from
<span class="antiqua">Cambden</span>, she bestowed her favours with
so much caution, and so little distinction,
as to prevent either party from gaining
the ascendant over her, whereby she remained
Mistress of her own self, and preserved
both their affections and her own
power and authority entire.</i></p>

<p>He proceeds to justify Q. <i>Eliz.</i> from
the imputation of avarice, by observing
that she neither hoarded up, nor
was lavish of the publick money.
Quotes a saying of the famous <i>Burleigh</i>,
that, <i>He never cared to see the treasury
swell like a disorder’d spleen, when the
other parts of the common-wealth were
in a Consumption</i>; and his mistress
thought that <i>money in the pockets of
her subjects was better than in her own</i>.</p>

<p>It was her maxim to save for the
publick not for herself, and to measure
her riches by the riches of the nation;
refused supplies offered, and remitted
payment of supplies granted, when the
publick service did not require it.
The two great principles of her Œconomy
were <i>1st.</i> Not suffering her Officers
to enrich themselves by fraud or
clandestine management. <i>2d.</i> Never
attempting to do any thing with money
that could be done with wisdom
or courage. (<i>See p. 319.</i>) For which cites
several instances; and observes how
greatly she promoted commerce, and
increased the fleet of <i>England</i>, which
before was inconsiderable.</p>

<h3><i>Jan. 9.</i> <span class="blackletter">Craftsman</span>, No. 236.</h3>

<p>All his oratory here is pointed at
the person of a <i>certain great man</i>
whom he represents as affecting all
the qualities and requisites of the
most consummate statesman, without
any qualifications in him necessary
for so high a post. He ridicules him
for a ready habit of <i>lying</i>, because it
is sometimes proper for a politician
to conceal the truth: Charges him
with a dark mysterious proceeding on
all Occasions, because <i>secrecy</i> is requir’d
in a statesman, and adds, that ’tis a
proof that his secret services are great
by the large sums requir’d for carrying
them on. Says, <i>good Intelligence</i> is another
excellent property in an able
statesman, and therefore our <i>mock-minister</i>
apes him in this particular;
gives a long detail of instances to illustrate
what he advances.</p>

<p>Confesses, indeed, that the fluctuation
of affairs hath oblig’d the ministry
to go from <i>court to court</i>; to make
treaties, which (as obsrv’d by the author
of the <i>London Journal</i>) <i>it is by no
means proper to execute</i>&mdash;&mdash;and adds,
<i>They found us engag’d in a treaty with
the Emperor; but they have very wisely
vary’d from it&mdash;&mdash;They made a Treaty
with <span class="antiqua">France</span>; and have hitherto very
wisely observ’d it&mdash;&mdash;they sent a large
squadron of ships, with an hostile appearance,
and without any declaration
of war, into the <span class="antiqua">West-Indies</span>; but they
wisely gave the Admiral instructions not
to make use of any other force than perswasion&mdash;&mdash;They
sent another squadron
into the <span class="antiqua">Baltick</span>; and a third into the
<span class="antiqua">Mediterranean</span>; but they very wisely
gave the Commanders of them the same
pacifick instructions; even tho’ <span class="antiqua">Spain</span>
was actually at war with us, and attacking
one of our most valuable possessions&mdash;&mdash;They
afterwards enter’d into
a treaty with <span class="antiqua">Spain</span>; but they have
hitherto very wisely declin’d to put it
in execution; and if they are now negotiating
another treaty at <span class="antiqua">Vienna</span>, as we
have been told, I doubt not that the
same wisdom will appear in it, whether
it is design’d to be put in execution or not.</i></p>

<p>He concludes by reducing his harangue
into a kind of problematical
order, and makes a great many bold
interrogatories, and answering of
which, he imagines, would lay his
opponents under the dilemma, of disapproving
their own conduct, or allowing
the justness of his arguments;
such as these; <i>Will our M&mdash;&mdash;r execute
the treaty of <span class="antiqua">Seville</span>, or will he not?
would a Reconciliation at <span class="antiqua">Vienna</span>, tho’
justifiable in other persons, be so in him?
hath not the <span class="antiqua">Emperor</span> shewn that he does
not fear us? will he not affect to show
that he doth not want us?</i> and many
other queries to the like purpose. See

<h3><span class="blackletter">Craftsman</span>, <i>Jan. 16.</i> No. 237.</h3>

<p>Complains of the hardship that
the authors of the <i>Craftsman</i> lye
under; that a certain gentleman
makes use of his authority to restrain
their pens, while he employs others
to throw about scandal at random;
and others are suffer’d to call the authors
of the <i>Craftsman</i>, traytors and
villains!</p>

<p>Makes some reflections on the <i>London
Journal Jan. 9.</i> which had took
to pieces his <i>Hague</i> Letter, concerning
the report of a negotiation at <i>Vienna</i>.</p>

<p>Mr <i>Osborne</i> in the <i>London Journal</i> having
exposed a paradox from the <i>Craftsman</i>,
that the ministry are never
right; when they do what the <i>Craftsmen</i>
count wrong: and yet wrong,
when they do what the <i>Craftsmen</i> count
right; the <i>Craftsman</i> observes, that
’tis allow’d that an accommodation
with the Emperor is a right measure,
but attended with fatal consequences,
and almost insuperable difficulties; because
such measures might be resented
by other courts as an infraction of
treaties, which Mr. <i>Osborne</i> says, were
only occasional and temporal.</p>

<p>The <i>Craftsman</i> supposes these alliances
to be such, but then asks, Will
our allies understand ’em in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
sense! If not, what may be the consequences?</p>

<p>As to what the <i>Craftsman</i> had granted,
that the fulness of time was come
to desert one ally, and to Mr. <i>Osborne</i>’s
reasons for such desertion, he replies
by demanding, Whether it was not
equally reasonable long ago?</p>

<p><i>Osborne</i> had ask’d&mdash;&mdash;if upon the
non-execution of this treaty, occasion’d
by the different views of the allies,
another court should grow stubborn,
what must we do? This the
<i>Craftsman</i> answers by another question,
that is, Whether the different views
of the allies do not proceed from their
different interests?</p>

<p class="center">From the Minutes of Mr. <i>Oldcastle</i>.</p>

<p>This paper continues remarks on
Q. <i>Elizabeth</i>’s reign; and is a
long <i>Encomium</i> on her management of
treaties with foreign powers, which
she always conducted in such a manner
as was best suited to the good of
her people and the honour and dignity
of the nation. Her <i>Ministry</i> went
wisely and steadily on to their own
great purposes <i>of preserving the peace of
<span class="antiqua">Europe</span>, and the trade and prosperity of

<h3>Craftsman, <i>Jan. 30.</i> No. 239.</h3>

<p>Maintains the liberty of the <i>Press</i>,
in opposition to those who argue
for the necessity of <i>some</i> restraint,
which, if granted, he says, might be
made use of to destroy all newspapers
whatsoever, except the <i>Gazette</i>.</p>

<p>After repeating most of the points
in debate, he defends his <i>Hague</i> letter
(for which the government thought
fit to call him to an account) in as
much as there was nothing in it asserted,
but only supposed; and adds, he
has as much right to reason upon
suppositions as Mr. <i>Osborne</i>; and to
censure the conduct of ministers, as he
hath to approve it; for unless the
right is reciprocal, the liberty of the
press is no liberty at all.</p>

<p>As to what Mr. <i>Walsingham</i> had
allow’d, that we have a right to reason
upon political affairs, tho’ not to
lay down false facts; he replies, that
he has asserted no falsehoods, and only
exercised the natural right of every
<i>Free Briton</i>, to offer his opinion on
affairs.</p>

<p>Concludes with saying, that if he

<h3><span class="blackletter">London</span> Journal. <i>Jan. 2.</i> No. 596.
against the <i>Craftsman</i>, No. 233.</h3>

<p>The <i>Craftsman</i> having in his said
<i>Journal</i> advanced several arguments
for the disbanding the <i>Army</i> and
repealing the <i>Riot Act</i>, the Author of
the <i>London Journal</i> undertakes here to
confute them. He admits that a Government
ought to have no more power
than is necessary for the safety and
protection, the preservation and happiness
of the people, but adds that the
laws alone, without a power to execute,
and provide against all sudden
emergencies, and possible dangers, will
not answer these ends. Asserts that
the possibility of powers being abused
is not a sufficient reason to strip the
Government of such a security, or
to lodge the safety of the King in the
affections of the people, which are variable
and easily seduced, and (as the
<i>Craftsman</i> allows) very precarious,
when he makes a doubt whether his
present Majesty enjoys them. Not only
<i>Armies</i> and <i>Riot Acts</i>, but even the
very law itself, by ill designing men
may be used for our destruction, which
were made for our safety. But must
we part with the law, because we may
suffer by the law? Every nation round
us is arm’d, and must we alone stand
naked and defenceless? If the liberties
of many nations have been destroy’d
by <i>standing armies</i>, the liberties of many
have been preserv’d by them. Mentions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the <i>Revolution</i> as an instance,
and believes the Pr. of <i>Orange</i> would
not have so easily succeeded, had the army
been as true to the King as they
were to their country. That the disbanding
the army after the peace of
<i>Riswick</i> embolden’d the <i>French King</i> to
set his Grandson on the Throne of
<i>Spain</i>, and declare the Pretender, which
involv’d us in a ten years war: That
nothing more intimidated the Ministry
in the last four years of Q. <i>Anne</i>’s
reign, than the honesty and bravery of
the gentlemen of the army.</p>

<p>As to the riot act, he says that power
is necessary to prevent riots and tumults,
and to disperse the people when
so assembled. To this purpose a law is
made which tells them the consequences
of it; a proper officer gives them
warning; and if after this they will
stay and be hang’d, ’tis their own
fault.</p>

<p>He allows, that shou’d a Justice of
the peace assume the liberty of reading
the proclamation where a member of
parliament is chusing, he ought to
be hang’d. He don’t see how this act
can injure us any other way; for
while the constitution is preserv’d,
and our liberties taken care of by the
government, the people can’t be unjustly
hurt by it.</p>

<p>The remaining part of his discourse
is spent in setting forth the unreasonableness
of repealing this act, from the
behaviour of the authors of the <i>Craftsman</i>
and their abettors, who by their
conduct in exciting uneasiness in the
people, have made it necessary to continue
it in force.</p>

<h3><i><span class="blackletter">London</span> Journal</i>, <i>Jan. 9</i>, No. 597.</h3>

<p>Contains remarks upon a paper
in the <i>Craftsman</i>, called, <i>An extract
of a letter from the <span class="antiqua">Hague</span></i>.</p>

<p>The author begins with observing,
that tho’ the pretence of the <i>Craftsman</i>
is liberty and patriotism, yet his
real design is opposition to the court.</p>

<p>He then reflects on the <i>Craftsman</i>’s
incoherent way of arguing, just as it
serves to vent his spleen; for according
to him the ministry are never
right when they do what he counts
wrong, and always wrong when they
do what the <i>Craftsman</i> counts right.</p>

<p>When we were broken with the Emperor
we were quite wrong, and now
we are going to unite with the Emperor
we are equally wrong.</p>

<p>This paper, or letter, the <i>Journalist</i>
says, is made up of mere conjectures,
and suppositions; or else insinuations,
unsupported by facts or reason: justifies
our ministry from the aspersion
that we are undoing what we have
been doing these five years; and insists
that we have been continuing to
do the same thing, that is, pursuing
the peace and happiness of the nation
by different means, as alterations happen’d,
or circumstances varied.</p>

<p>He then answers the <i>Craftsman</i>’s
charge of deserting one ally, by supposing
that this ally may have views
inconsistent with the two other allies,
and so stand disposed to act contrary
to the design of that treaty and our
interest. <i>England</i> is not obliged to
execute the treaty, unless the other
allies will act their part.</p>

<p>The <i>Craftsman</i> charges the ministry
with obstinate perseverance in bad
measures, and now with a precipitate
alteration of councils. This the author
of this <i>Journal</i> denies, and says, it
should be more justly called, a wise
and prudent accommodating themselves
to the late unfortunate juncture
of affairs. Changing hands is not an
alteration of councils, but a conduct
which wise and honest men ought to
observe.</p>

<h3><i><span class="blackletter">London</span> Journal</i>, <i>Jan. 16.</i> No. 598.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Reflections on the present State of Affairs,
occasion’d by the <span class="antiqua">Craftsman</span>, Jan. 9.</i></p>

<p>He takes notice of the <i>Craftsman</i>’s
method of drawing of characters,
in which he offends all the laws
of honesty, propriety and decorum;
charges without evidence or reason,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and without common sense; makes
his <i>Mock-minister</i> a composition of insolence,
malice, and a small talent for
ridicule, yet is not half so odious as
the <i>Mock-patriot</i> who drest him; who,
while he counterfeits publick virtue,
is infamously abusing the publick:
clothes himself with the love of his
country, while he is making a jest of
it; and injures the community, while
he pretends the highest regard for it;
and who, because we have tried all
possible ways to preserve the peace,
calls our ministers <i>Dupes</i> of all the
powers of <i>Europe</i>, <i>political Mendicants</i>,
strolling about from court to court.</p>

<p>The <i>Craftsman</i> having advanc’d, that
we are inexcuseable for not having foreseen
and prevented these conjunctures
in which nothing can be done which
is not a fault to do; our author asks,
what conjunctures those are, in which
a man is not at liberty to act reasonably
and honestly? or can it be a
fault so to act?</p>

<p>By the treaty of <i>Seville</i> we only
yielded to <i>Spain</i> a point, which, in
real interest, concerned some of the
contending powers. It could hardly
be imagin’d that the Emperor would
have put himself to the expence, or
hazard of a war, for the small deviation
of the <i>Quadruple Alliance</i>, had he
not been informed, that the allies
could not agree about the war; or
that they disagreed about the scene
of action; or, for the sake of peace,
the allies might all concur to wait
<i>one Year</i> to see what the Emperor
would do. Any of these suppositions
affords a reason why the treaty of
<i>Seville</i> is not yet executed.</p>

<p>As to the queries put by the <i>Craftsman</i>,
(p. 4.) they are all ask’d for the
sake of the two last, which demand,
Will not this measure of making up
with the Emperor be attended with
worse consequences than turning out
the minister? and&mdash;&mdash;Will the objections
against it, be so strong, if
manag’d by another hand?&mdash;&mdash;he
answers no; for persons don’t alter
the relation of things, or change
the nature of actions. If it is reasonable,
’tis equally so whoever does it.</p>

<h3><i><span class="blackletter">London</span> Journal</i>, <i>Jan. 23.</i> No. 599.</h3>

<p>By the behaviour of the ministry
for some years past, it evidently
appears, that the preserving the peace
of <i>Europe</i>, and securing the trade and
prosperity of the kingdom, has been
their greatest concern; but whether
means taken to that end have been
always right, is not so easily determin’d.</p>

<p>The sword indeed might have cut
our way to peace, and added to our
glory, but the event might have prov’d
a general war.&mdash;&mdash;Our ministry
thought wisdom better than power.
To this end, when our enemies arm’d
we put ourselves in a posture of defence;
we suffer’d little insults, as a
proof that we were willing to be <i>one</i>
with a nation with whom it is our
interest to be <i>one</i>. To this end we
united those who were disjoin’d, and
separated those who were united; still
avoiding a war.</p>

<p>But while the ministry have been
industrious in preventing confusions,
and watching opportunities of accommodating
differences, their adversaries
have practis’d all imaginary ways to
insult and embarrass them.</p>

<p><i>Osborne</i> clears himself from the imputation
which the <i>Craftsman</i> had
charg’d him with, <i>viz.</i> that the supposition
that we are going to unite
with the Emperor, will be attended
with perfidy, infraction of treaties,
and violation of faith.</p>

<h3><i><span class="blackletter">London</span> Journal</i>, <i>Jan. 30.</i> No. 600.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Admits that this Queen was a wise
and glorious Princess, but says that
our <i>Constitution</i>, and the <i>exercise of Power
at home</i>, is vastly better than what
they were in her reign, and our <i>Foreign
Affairs</i> transacted with as much
wisdom.</p>

<p>Quotes Mr. <i>Oldcastle</i>’s own words,
in which he describes the <i>Wisdom</i> and

the <i>Wisdom</i> and <i>Address</i> of the present
Minister in negotiating <i>Foreign Affairs</i>.
(See p. 3.)</p>

<p>Lastly, he gives several maxims out
of <i>Cambden</i> and <i>Francis Osborne</i>’s memoirs
of this Queen, such as her preferring
peace to war; her delaying resentment
of injuries till proper seasons;
her judgment of her subjects
abilities, which she dextrously fitted

her steady resolution not to
ransom herself from her enemies at
the price of their preferments who
lov’d her.</p>

<h3><i><span class="blackletter">Fog’s</span> Journal</i>, <i>Saturday, January 9.</i>
No. 120.</h3>

<p>A Letter is inserted, containing remarks
on Mr. <i>Chubb</i>’s discourse
concerning <i>Reason</i>, in which is asserted,
that <i>it either is, or ought to be a sufficient
guide in matters of Religion</i>.</p>

<p>This Proposition the remarker explains
in the words of Mr. <i>Chubb</i>, and
assents to, and then proceeds to consider
it more particularly. Does not
comprehend Mr. <i>Chubb</i>’s observation,
i. e. <i>The Question is not whether there
be absolutely such a capacity in man</i>:
for if man has such a capacity, as Mr.
<i>Chubb</i> insists, he may be truly said to
be the possessor of it. Nor can the remarker
understand the sense of that
clause, <i>he ought to have</i>, because it has
no relation to the dispute between
Mr. <i>Chubb</i> and the Bp of <i>London</i>, i. e.
what man <i>now</i> has, and is capable of.</p>

<p>The remarker goes on to shew, that
the author’s argument to prove that
man <i>ought</i> to have such a capacity, is
needless, because it is universally assented
to.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Chubb</i> argues, <i>That as our species
was no ways accessary to <span class="antiqua">Adam’s</span> transgression,
’tis unreasonable and unequal
that they should suffer by it.</i></p>

<p>To this is answer’d, that there are
other difficulties in the general scheme
of providence as hard to be solved; as
that, whole families are involved in
misery by the mismanagement of their
ancestor; the entailment of chronick
and terrible disorders on children by
the debaucheries of a father, for that
it is <i>wrong intolerable</i>, and against
reason to punish children for the
crimes of their fathers. But all these
difficulties which seem to clash with
the wisdom and goodness of God, are
rectify’d in a future state, for which
we are manifestly fitted and design’d.</p>

<h3><i><span class="blackletter">Fog’s</span> Journal</i>, <i>Jan. 16.</i> No. 121.</h3>

<p>This paper begins with a piece of
humourous irony; observing that
as criticks never appear so disappointed
as when they meet with beauties in an
author; so the present sett of disaffected
political writers conceive no
small joy to see their country involv’d
in difficulties; nor can they be worse
mortified than to see this nation flourish
in trade, wealth and credit.</p>

<p>That <i>Osborne</i> (writer of the <i>London
Journal</i>) and <i>Walsingham</i> (of the <i>Free
Briton</i>) affirm, That the present crew
of factious writers proceeds on this
principle. Descants upon the measures
for some years past; the destruction of
the <i>Spanish</i> Fleet in the <i>Mediterranean</i>,
whereby <i>Sicily</i> was gain’d for the Emperor,
and the preservation of the balance
of <i>Europe</i> so ill settled by that
wicked treaty of <i>Utrecht</i>.</p>

<p>Mentions some of the great Actions
which have stirr’d up the envy of the
disaffected; as, the sending annual
fleets into the <i>Baltick</i>; the treaty of
<i>Hanover</i>; the maintaining a body of
<i>Hessian</i> troops; sending squadrons to
the coasts of <i>Spain</i> and the <i>West-Indies</i>,
the expedition to <i>Spithead</i> and lastly,
the treaty of <i>Seville</i>. This last, he
ironically says, had like to have kill’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the disaffected quite, because it was
so wisely calculated for establishing a
general tranquillity, and for the advancing
the trade of <i>Great Britain</i>!</p>

<p>He goes on throwing his sarcasms
at the writers on the side of the present
ministry, who having challeng’d
the disaffected to show any one step
taken destructive of the true interest
of their country, instances in the opening
the harbour of <i>Dunkirk</i>, the Island
of St. <i>Lucia</i> planted by the <i>French</i>;
raising recruits in <i>Ireland</i> for the service
of <i>France</i>; all which the two
writers aforemention’d, convinced the
world were groundless, by telling the
authors of these reports, they lyed.</p>

<p>He makes some reflections on Mr.
<i>Osborne</i>’s observations of the ill conduct
of the ministry in the latter end of
Q. <i>Anne</i>’s reign; as the endeavours
to break the power of the Dissenters,
and to weaken the security of the
<i>Hanover</i> succession; setting aside the
<i>Quaker</i>’s affirmation; the disbanding
the army. All which <i>Fog</i> laughs at!
and concludes with his surprize, that
when he considers with how much
good sense these two writers have exposed
the actions of that <i>Tory</i> ministry,
and how they have defended
the measures of the present, there
should be a disaffected person left in
the kingdom.</p>

<h3><span class="blackletter">Fog’s Journal</span>, <i>Jan. 23.</i> No. 123.</h3>

<p>This Paper consists of reflections
on a pamphlet, intituled, <i>A Defence
of the Measures of the present Administration</i>.</p>

<p>He begins with the observation
which the author had made: “That
complaints and outcries are no
foundation for supposing defects in
publick counsels; for in a frame of
government like ours, a continuance
of the same administration
will always lessen the popularity of
the ministry.</p>

<p>“The frequent use of this observation,
<i>Fog</i> says, is enough to shew
its good sense. ’Twas first started
by the Rev. Author of the Enquiry,
all the anniversary pamphlets have
had it since, and it has been repeated
by Mr. <i>Osborne</i> 75 times;
by Mr. <i>Walsingham</i> twice as many;
nor is there any thing in this pamphlet
but what has the authority
of, at least, 50 repetitions”: yet
he cannot subscribe to his opinion; for
supposing it true, it is a sure sign that
affairs are well conducted; but if the
contempt of all men of sense be added
to this clamour, oh! then we
pronounce him an angel.</p>

<p>He goes on to quote another passage;
“That the Peace of <i>Utrecht</i> left
us on good terms with <i>Spain</i>, which
might have turn’d to our advantage,
had our affairs been wisely manag’d
in the late reign; but as they
were not, it laid the foundation of
the several perplexities that have
since attended us.”</p>

<p>This conduct of the last reign, <i>Fog</i>
says, ought to be apply’d to a person
or two since dead, and not to the present
ministers. Adds, that he might
have spar’d his encomium of the <i>Utrecht</i>
treaty, or shewn us the folly
of cultivating a good understanding
with the <i>Emperor</i> and <i>Spain</i> at the same
time, by which our affairs, every where
were left in <i>a stupid calm</i>; for had
they contriv’d to make either of ’em
our enemy, we should always have
had a quarrel and a treaty depending,
and so have given vent to our humours
and money too.</p>

<p>The author having said, that when
the present ministry came into power,
they observ’d from the complexion of
things mischief must be gath’ring some
where, which prov’d to be an alliance
betwixt <i>Spain</i> and the <i>Emperor</i>.
This, <i>Fog</i> affirms, was very sagacious;
but that the treaty he speaks of was,
and still is deny’d by both the parties.</p>

<p>He then criticises on several other
parts of the discourse, especially on
those which extol the conduct of our
ministry and their management of our
affairs, relating to the inaction of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
squadron sent to the <i>West Indies</i>, and
keeping back the <i>Spanish</i> Treasure,
thereby rendring it useless, as to any
dangerous purposes.</p>

<p>The wisdom of this conduct, <i>Fog</i>
takes notice, proved itself in the Event;
The <i>Spaniards</i> were provoked;
sent out their privateers, and pillag’d
our merchants!</p>

<p>As to humouring the Q. of <i>Spain</i>
in settling the <i>Italian</i> dukedoms on
Don <i>Carlos</i>, says, sneeringly, besides obliging
a fair Lady, <i>Great Britain</i> has
gain’d the treaty of <i>Seville</i>!</p>

<h3><span class="blackletter">Fog’s Journal</span>, <i>Jan. 30.</i> No. 124.</h3>

<p><i>The Press</i>, says he, <i>has lately swarm’d
with writing <span class="antiqua">pro</span> and <span class="antiqua">con</span>, upon the
present posture of affairs, by which we
find that one party is of opinion, that
ministers of state are no more than <span class="antiqua">men</span>;
t’other will have ’em to be <span class="antiqua">angels</span> (that
is while they continue in power.)&mdash;&mdash;Here
you read, that Affairs are in no
better situation than they should be&mdash;&mdash;there,
that we have neither past miscarriages,
or present grievances to complain
of, and that the nation never was in so
flourishing a condition. One <span class="antiqua">D’Anvers</span>,
and, if I mistake not, one <span class="antiqua">Fog</span>, are accused
of seditiously asserting that a <span class="antiqua">Crow</span>
is black, but the writers on the other
side, have with infinite Wit, proved a
<span class="antiqua">black Crow</span> to be the <span class="antiqua">whitest</span> bird of
all the feather’d kind.</i></p>

<p>He proceeds thus merrily to remark
on a pamphlet intitled, <i>Considerations
on the present state of affairs, with regard
to the Number of Forces in the Pay of
<span class="antiqua">Great Britain</span></i>; and endeavours, in his
ironical way, to overthrow the several
arguments advanced by the author
for maintaining the <i>Hessian</i> troops,
and concludes with giving his opinion
that they will be very far from convincing
the disaffected.</p>

<h3><span class="blackletter">The Grub-street</span> Journal, <i>Thursday,
Jan. 14.</i> No. 53.</h3>

<p>Dr. <i>Quibus</i> chuses for the subject
of his discourse the operation
designed to be performed on the ears
of one <i>Rey</i>, a condemn’d malefactor,
by Mr. <i>Cheselden</i>. This he treats in a
ludicrous manner, and supposes that
if Mr. <i>Rey</i> should prove so unphilosophical
as to give the surgeon the
slip as soon as the operation is over,
we should be as much in the dark as
we were before. He declares his opinion,
that not only the drum, but the
whole organ, or the ear it self, is of
no use at all in hearing, and would
know the truth of his conjecture by
seeing the ears of some malefactor entirely
extirpated. Recommends it as a
thing of great use, if instead of executing
malefactors they were made
to undergo such kind of experiments.
Trial may be made whether the <i>Retina</i>
of the eye is of any use in seeing.
A needle might be introduced into
the eye, and the <i>Retina</i> quite remov’d.
The spleen might be taken out of
some vile malefactor, and an observation
made whether their inclinations
to evil courses depend not on a
superfluity of the <i>Atra Bilis</i>. Another
experiment he recommends as of great
consequence, that is, whether the tying
up one of the testicles would not
determine the sex of a child begotten
at such a time. By this means,
he says, many illustrious families
might be inform’d of a just and certain
method of obtaining an heir to
their estates. <i>See</i> p. 19.</p>

<h3>The <span class="blackletter">Grub-street</span> Journal, <i>Thursday,
Jan. 14.</i> No. 54.</h3>

<p>The author begins with the <i>Laureat</i>’s
new-year’s ode (for which
<a href="#Page_20">see p. 20.</a>) and subjoins to it some
explanatory notes; the substance of
which is contain’d in the following
short remarks.</p>

<p><i>Line</i> 1. The eternity of the world
is here maintain’d, tho’ Dr. <i>Clarke</i>
had objected against it.</p>

<p>3. Old <i>Janus</i>, a heathenish emblem,
is supplanted by <i>old Time</i>, as more familiar
to christian readers.</p>

<p>5. To this is objected, making <i>Spring
a living person calling for birth</i> as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
were to <i>old Time</i>; whereas <i>old Time</i>
had bid <i>spring pass</i>, so no occasion for
<i>spring to call</i>. Which is defended thus;
When <i>time bids spring pass</i>, it might
not be ready, but as soon as it was,
it <i>calls for birth</i>.</p>

<p>Line 7. <i>Harvest</i> in <i>summer</i> is very
early, and something unusual.</p>

<p>9. But not soon enough, it seems,
because here <i>each season</i> is said <i>to bring
<span class="antiqua">THEIR</span> stores <span class="antiqua">TO</span> winter’s wants, <span class="antiqua">till</span>
warmer genial suns recall the spring</i>&mdash;&mdash;However
Mr. <i>Cibber</i>’s authority makes
it current.</p>

<p>15. An admirable improvement of
<i>Nocte pluit tota</i>, &amp;c. which to set in a
true light is translated and imitated:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>It rains all night, the shows returns with day:</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Thus <span class="antiqua">Jove</span> and <span class="antiqua">Cæsar</span> bear divided sway.</i></div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><i>Plenty is Heav’n’s, and Peace our Monarch’s care,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Thus <span class="antiqua">Jove</span> and <span class="antiqua">George</span> divided Empire share.</i></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But to this was objected, that we
are not only indebted to heaven for
<i>plenty</i>, but for <i>peace</i> too, tho’ like
marriages said to be made there, it
was not yet come down.</p>

<p>21. It is queried what <i>war</i> and
<i>peace</i> the poet means here.</p>

<p>22. An emendation of this line is
offer’d to make it clear,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>We triumph most when <span class="antiqua">MOST</span> the farmer feeds.</i></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and the <i>Beef eaters at <span class="antiqua">St.</span> James</i>’s, are
appeal’d to for the justness of it.</p>

<p>23, 24. The elegance of these lines
are literally defended, but the propriety
and cadence of them are called in question.</p>

<p>25, 26, 27, 21. These seem inconsistent
with the 19th and 20th verses.</p>

<p>As in the 35th, and 46th lines,
<i>Phœbus</i> had roll’d in vain, till <i>Albion</i>
could behold such a sight as at present
on the throne, well might the poet
make the exclamation in the 37th and
38th.</p>

<p>39, 40. As it is impossible always
to REACH <i>our own desires</i>, tho’ required
by heaven, it is proposed to alter
it to TEACH; that is, instruct united
hearts to address the throne by
their own loyal <i>desires</i>.</p>

<p>41. Read <i>selfish</i>, as better than <i>self-born</i>;
all views whatever being such.</p>

<p>46. <i>Suns</i> probably should be read
<i>sons</i>, because it seems to be a contradiction
to ever circling <i>sun</i>, line 1.</p>

<p>The criticiser concludes with observing,
that when a song is good
sense, it must be made nonsense before
it is made musick; so when a song is
nonsense, there’s no other way but by
singing it to make it seem tolerable
sense.</p>

<h3><i><span class="blackletter">Grub-street</span> Journal</i>, <i>Jan. 21.</i> No. 55.</h3>

<p>The author begins with observing
that nothing has increased their
society so much as poetry: We are
taught it at school; if not, believe
we are born poets. Every corner abounds
with its professors; the bellman
nightly salutes his master and
mistress: the marshal, his gentlemen
soldiers every Christmas; every
street rings with ballads; the royal
palace resounds with odes; and every
church-yard with its productions:
<i>Stephen Duck</i>’s good fortune has occasion’d
a poor Weaver in <i>Spittle-fields</i>
to publish a miscellany of poems
which he addresses to the Queen, and
introduces with this line.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Thy fortune, <span class="antiqua">Duck</span>, affects my kindred mind;</i></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Wherefore <i>Grub st.</i> presumes to represent
to her Majesty, that the best way
to encourage the Weaver, would be to
wear British manufactures; and the
thresher, by giving him a small farm
in the country; and to restrain both
from writing a line more in rhime or
measure.</p>

<p>Apprehends, that from this general
inclination to write, they shall be
oblig’d, like the royal society, to
discourage intruders amongst them,
and, to prevent misunderstanding,
proposes that no person shall be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
member of both societies at the same
time.</p>

<h3><i><span class="blackletter">Grub-street</span> Journal</i>, <i>Jan. 21.</i> No. 56.</h3>

<p>Makes some remarks concerning
the management of controversies
between the political writers. This
he illustrates by two examples; by
which he would intimate the spirit
that animates and governs both parties.
The first is a quotation of two severe
personal characters, from a pamphlet
entitled <i>Sedition and Defamation display’d,
in a Letter to the Author of the
Craftsman</i>. The other is some paragraphs
attacking two characters on
the opposite side, drawn from the Pamphlet
call’d, <i>A proper reply to a late
scurrilous libel intitled Sedition and Defamation
display’d; in a Letter to the
author, by Caleb D’anvers Esq;</i> which
four characters he supposes imaginary,
for if they were real, no man of
sense, honour, or honesty would espouse
them.</p>

<h3><span class="blackletter">Weekly Register</span>, <i>Jan. 9.</i> No. 39.</h3>

<p>The <i>Register</i> publishes a mystical
letter from a club of Gardners,
wherein is figuratively describ’d the
evils which the fraternity have occasionally
suffer’d from the depredations
<i>of Locusts</i>, <i>Palmer-worms</i>, <i>Caterpillars</i>,
and other pestiferous vermin. Several
discourses were made by the members
concerning the Origin and Progress of
these their common enemies. One of
the company said, that the first appearance
of them is in a sort of spawn,
spread over the cabbage-leaves, which
gradually rises into <i>Grubs</i>. This <i>Grubbean</i>
race, he reckons, are descendants of
the <i>Egyptian Locusts</i>, and the <i>Palmer-worms</i>
and <i>Caterpillars</i>, a spurious offspring
of the <i>Locusts</i>. Another of the
society believes they are of an <i>English</i>
extraction; gives several significations
of the word <i>Grub</i>, and then runs a parallel
between the insects called <i>Grubs</i>,
and the <i>Grubean Society, or Grubstreet
Journalists</i>. To which he adds a remark,
that ’tis something strange a
body of Men should set themselves up to
make a merit of other men’s faults:
they must of course be despicable themselves,
because they take a pleasure in
making others appear so.</p>

<p>Remembers that in the late wartime
many postscripts to the <i>Flying-Posts</i>
were bawl’d about with abundance
of news, but scarce a word of
truth: So that paper gain’d the name
of the <i>Lying Post</i>, and was called <i>Grub-street
News</i>. And still it’s a common
appellation, when we hear full and
true accounts cry’d by our doors, <i>’tis
Grubstreet, all Grubstreet</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="blackletter">Weekly Register</span>, Jan. 16. No. 40.</h3>

<p class="center">On <i>Ridicule</i>, address’d to the authors
of the <i>Grubstreet-Journal</i>.</p>

<p><i>Says, Ridicule is a general practice, and
proceeds either from the wantonness
of our own vanity, or contempt of others
frailties. We take the same pleasure in
scandal as monkies do in mischief. Wonders
why the Tea-table should be thought
the mother of scandal, or the nurse of ridicule,
when all mankind is pursuing
the same pleasure under different disguises.
They condemn Censure in others,
that they may indulge it themselves. The
taverns are as accessary to it as private
houses. Courts are esteemed the source
of politeness and good manners; theatres
of ingenuity, churches of sanctity; yet all
are infected with the evil of scandal.
Seems to prefer the gaming-table as freest
from irony and slander; avarice being a
spirit that allows of no rival. This vice
is contagious, and runs thro’ the whole
people: it wanders every where, like an
<span class="antiqua">ignis fatuus</span>, and is only at home in the
<span class="antiqua">Grubstreet-Journal</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>Don’t pretend how far this libertinism
of speech is allowable, but is certain that
every moral man will use it only for the
sake of him he censures; and every gentleman
will make good manners the only
rule of behaviour. All men are jealous
of their characters, and we must
have a due complaisance for one frailty
while we would reform another; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the insolence of knowledge is as insupportable
as the affectation of folly. The
subjects of ridicule are to be justly chosen
and carefully distinguished.</i></p>

<p><i>Concludes with some Reflections on the
authors of the <span class="antiqua">Grubstreet-Journal</span>, who
have undertaken the drudgery of invective
under pretence of being champions
for politeness.</i></p>

<h3><span class="blackletter">Weekly Register</span>, <i>Jan. 24.</i> No. 41.</h3>

<p>He remarks, that from an ambition
of emulating, without a
capacity to equal another’s excellencies,
have arisen an infinite number
of pretenders to reputation. The regular
physician is intruded upon by the
empyrick; the masterly painter is
slighted in favour of impudence and
ignorance; the most elegant and chaste
compositions of musick, are forc’d to
give way to amusements less polite:
Quackery interferes with trade, and
undermines honesty. The pedlar stiles
himself a merchant; No wonder then
that authors of every character are so
wretchedly personated. Exclaims against
bad writers, from the Court-scribbler
to the <i>Grubstreet</i> hackney.</p>

<p>Proceeds to the description of a
good author; says, his principal end,
in occasional writings, should be to
entertain the publick innocently and
genteely; to insinuate knowledge in
the disguise of amusement, and trifle
the world into virtue and good manners:
he should consider every reader
as a critick and a gentleman, and be
earful of offending either: points out
what a writer should observe, who
would recommend himself and entertain
the world; <i>i. e.</i> an important
subject, a clear and expressive method,
a flowing and natural stile, imagination
and judgment, truth and impartiality,
modesty in his images, pity
for the failings of human nature, and
endeavours to amend ’em. He shou’d
think himself a son of the publick
and be an example of the generous
spirit he would recommend; he should
be able to race the passions thro’ all
their disguises; have knowledge in his
head, and good humour in his heart:
he should be an enemy to vice, but a
friend to all mankind.</p>

<h3><span class="blackletter">Weekly Register</span>, <i>Jan. 30.</i> No. 42.</h3>

<p>This is a continuation of a former
discourse upon criticism,
wherein he points out several excellencies
that distinguish a good critick
from a bad.</p>

<p>He then considers the manner of
criticism, that some are <i>Fox-hunters</i> in
censure, and declare war against all
writers in general. Some are like <i>Fig</i>
and <i>Sutton</i>, the declar’d antagonists to
one another. Some are <i>Whigs</i> and <i>Tories</i>,
divided into parties, always applauding
themselves, and condemning
their opposers. Some are <i>Grubstreet</i>
hawkers, who make a penny of throwing
about censure at random without
distinction or regard of persons.</p>

<p>The design of criticism is amendment;
and concludes with acknowledging
his own failings, and his readiness
to be handsomely corrected.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Stonecastle</i>, the nominal author,
begins this day’s entertainment
with observing that men are
not born for themselves; that we are
not only bound to relieve the necessities
of others, but in all our dealings,
<i>&amp;c.</i> with mankind to render ourselves
grateful to all, offensive to
none, much less take pleasure in doing
disagreeable things. Says there
is a sett of people who are frequently
committing ill-bred, rude, and even
shocking things, which they excuse
by only saying, ’tis their humour.
Instances in a certain knight, who
never spoke himself, nor suffer’d any
body in his presence to speak louder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
than to be barely heard; insomuch
that his servants, as they were accustom’d
to be mutes at home, behav’d
like no body when they came
abroad.</p>

<p>His nephew <i>Silvio</i>, just come from
the university, declaims on every subject
you can mention, and imagines
himself master of every science.
Whatever is the topick of discourse,
he will suffer no body to talk upon it
but himself; his uncle has but one
hope of curing him of his folly, that
is, by engaging him to talk of maritime
affairs before captain <i>Firebal</i> of
the <i>Tempest</i>, who, very probably, will
beat him into better manners.</p>

<p>Beauty itself loses its attraction
when accompanied with these humours.</p>

<p><i>Artemisa</i> is exquisitely handsome,
but takes the liberty of abusing every
body at random, by asking ill-natur’d
questions, and being witty upon
others imperfections: excuses herself
by saying, ’tis her way to tell unlucky
truths and she can’t help it.</p>

<p><i>Crito</i> is a man of sense, learning,
and accuracy of judgment; but this
ought not to privilege him to treat
every writer he does not like with
opprobrious language.</p>

<p><i>Belliza</i> has wit and beauty, accompanied
with a solid judgment. Yet
all this will hardly palliate the disgust
she gives people with whom she
eats. She never uses a fork, is be-greased
up to the knuckles, and by her
immoderate taking of snuff, which
frequently falling among her sauce,
she gives her guests their bellies full
before they have half din’d. Concludes
with a merry story of a certain
Colonel, whose flight it was,
when he had drank a glass or two
too much, to fire off and play tricks
with his pistols. One night the col.
having drank too freely order’d, his
footman, who was an <i>Irishman</i> newly
hired, to bring his pistols, <i>Teague</i>
obey’d; the Col. loaded them both,
and having lock’d the door commanded
his man to hold one of the candles
at arm’s length, till he snuff’d
it with a ball. Prayers and intreaties
were in vain, and comply he must,
and did, tho’ trembling; the Col.
perform’d the operation at the first
attempt, then laying down his pistols
was going to unlock the door. <i>Teague</i>
catches up that which was loaded,
‘Arra Maishter, says he, but now you
must take up t’other candle, and let
me have my shoot too.’ The col.
call’d him rogue and rascal to no purpose,
<i>Teague</i> was now vested with
power, and would be obey’d: Accordingly
his master extended the candle,
but this being the first time of <i>Teague</i>’s
performing, he not only miss’d, but
shot off a button from the breast of
the colonel’s coat. So narrow an
escape had a good effect, and cur’d
him of this humour of turning marksman in
his drink.</p>

<h3>The <span class="blackletter">Universal Spectator</span>, <i>Jan. 9.</i>
No. 118.</h3>

<p>Contains two Letters, with the
<i>Spectator’s</i> answers to them.</p>

<p>The first is from a gentleman, who,
about three months since, fell passionately
in love with a lady at a ball;
gives an account of his courtship,
and of the kind reception of his addresses
during that time, till of a sudden,
without any reason given, or objection
made, the lady sent him a peremptory
message to desist any further
pursuit. Complains that ’tis ungenerous
and unjust to keep people so long
in suspence, with no design but to
gratify female pride and vanity.</p>

<p>To this the <i>Spectator</i> replies, That
the lady gave him fair play, and an
opportunity of rendring himself agreeable;
which when she found he could
not, she very civilly, by a third person,
desir’d him to desist. However,
he says, ’tis but reasonable that the lady
should give him a certificate of his
good behaviour during his courtship.</p>

<p>The second letter is from a young
lady of 15, who signs herself <i>Carolina</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
which may be summ’d up and comprized
in those two queries.</p>

<p>1. <i>May a Woman entertain several
lovers at the same time?</i></p>

<p>2. <i>After a Woman has once receiv’d
a man’s addresses, may she with honour
turn him off?</i></p>

<p>To the first he answers, <i>That such a
licence might be granted, if nothing was
design’d by it but the chusing of the most
deserving for a husband; but considering
the inconveniences that would necessarily
attend such an indulgence, he durst not
allow it.</i></p>

<p>The second query he grants in the
affirmative; that is, <i>if she discovers
him false and base, or uncapable of making
her happy</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="blackletter">Universal Spectator</span>, <i>January, 16.</i>
No. 119.</h3>

<p>Contains a letter from a physician,
in which he describes the miserable
condition of his patients, that
apply to him on the <i>venereal</i> account.
Of this sort the most unfortunate and
pitiful object is a woman of the town,
who, if not quite abandon’d, gives
a loose to her passion on such occasions.
The consideration of her past,
present, and future state, fills her
with distraction, and involves her in
endless evils, from which death only
can deliver her.</p>

<p>Proceeds to argue with the infamous
authors of the misery of these wretches,
who first seduce the poor young
creatures from their innocence, and
then triumph in their wickedness.
He who debauches a maiden, and then
exposes her to want and shame, is arrived
to such a monstrous height of
villany, that no word in our language
can reach it. Mentions a further species
of cruelty, that is, the necessity
some of these poor wretches are under,
if with child, of applying to a magistrate
to procure some pitiful maintenance
for her unfortunate babe.&mdash;&mdash;When
all that is to be done by the father,
is to make the best bargain he
can with the church-wardens to take
it off his hands; which is commonly
done for a treat, and 10 or 12<i>l.</i> So
the child is placed upon the parish,
and the woman upon the town.</p>

<h3><span class="blackletter">Univers. Spectator</span>, <i>Jan. 23.</i> No. 120.</h3>

<p>Entertains his readers with two
letters; the first is from <i>Tristitia
Stale</i>, who complains that she is continually
persecuted, merely because
she is an old maid.</p>

<p>Virginity, she says, has not always
been a reproach, sees no encouragement
in matrimony, and begs the
<i>Spectator</i> to reprimand the malaperts,
who ridicule chastity; adds, that a
single life in woman was esteem’d among
the ancient as well as modern
Romans; vestals then, and nuns now.</p>

<p>The other letter is from <i>Charlotte
Wilful</i>, a young lady of 19, who says
she has two admirers. The first is
’squire <i>Scrape</i>, who has 1200<i>l.</i> <i>per
annum</i>, which he keeps in his own
hands and farms himself, and therefore
is favour’d in his pretentions by
her father.</p>

<p>Mr <i>Myrtle</i>, her mother’s favourite,
is the other, who, by his own account
is near 40, by that of his acquaintance
10 years older, has squander’d
away a good estate, but by the death
of an uncle is now worth 1000<i>l.</i> <i>per
annum</i>, and is a perfect humourist.</p>

<p>But to both these she prefers Mr
<i>Plume</i> of the <i>Inner-Temple</i>, who has
no estate, but is of a sweet temper.
Concludes with desiring Mr <i>Stonecastle</i>
to declaim on parents making choices
for their Children, with a stroke on
antiquated beaus, and rural animals,
and to recommend a fine gentleman
with no fortune. Desires, by way of
postscript, that he would not delay
publishing her letter, because Mr
<i>Plume</i> and she had agreed to run away
together on <i>Tuesday</i> next.</p>

<h3>The <span class="blackletter">Universal Spectator</span>, <i>Jan. 30.</i>
No. 121.</h3>

<p>Among all those amusements people
find to pass away the time, <i>Poesy</i>
and <i>Musick</i> are the most elegantly entertaining.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
By the ancients they were
look’d upon as immediately inspired
from above, and the professors reverenc’d
as sacred, and the favourites of
heaven.</p>

<p>He adds, that we excel the ancients
in musick, if not in poetry, and prefers
a good <i>English</i> song, tho’ set to a
common tune, before the <i>Italian</i> trifling
unnatural compositions. The
<i>one</i> ravishes the ear only, the <i>other</i>
entertains the understanding also.&mdash;&mdash;Hence

<h3><span class="blackletter">Free Briton</span>, <i>Jan. 7.</i> No. 58.</h3>

<p>The author refutes a falsity advanced
by Mr <i>D’anvers</i> in the
<i>Craftsman</i> of the 13th of <i>Dec.</i> wherein,
speaking of the riot-act, he says,
“That an election of Church-wardens
hath been already made a
handle for putting this law in execution.
That the master of a small
vessel was kept a whole year in prison,
to the loss of his voyage, and
almost the ruin of his family, upon
happening to go thro’ the church-yard,
from visiting a friend, an
hour after the proclamation was
read. Nay, that the poor man
might have run the hazard of his
life, as well as have been put to further
expences, if his late Majesty
had not been graciously pleas’d to
grant him a <i>Noli prosequi</i>.”</p>

<p>The falsehood of this story the <i>Free
Briton</i> thus corrects.&mdash;The gentlemen
of <i>Greenwich</i> disagreeing upon the
choice of a church-warden at <i>Easter</i>
1722, a poll was demanded and a scrutiny
afterwards agreed on. The scrutineers
met, but a number of dissolute
persons tumultuously assembling at
the same time, insulted the justices in
a rude and outragious manner, (justice
<i>Savory</i> receiving a blow on the
back by a great stone) so that it was
thought proper to read the proclamation
in order to disperse them. Among
the rioters was <i>Charles Curtis</i>, master
of a small vessel. He was with
them before, at, and after the proclamation
was read, and very notorious
by his behaviour; was several times
admonished by the justices to depart;
and as often very civilly acquainted
by them with the ill consequence
of his continuance in that riotous
assembly. But notwithstanding their
repeated admonitions, he still continued,
and was found among the rioters
an hour and a half after the Proclamation
was read, and being even
then advised to leave that place, and
to avoid the fatal consequence, the
said <i>Curtis</i>, still refused to depart,
and insisted with uncommon insolence,
that he was as much about his
business in that place as the justices
themselves. Whereupon he was apprehended,
committed to <i>Maidstone
Gaol</i>, try’d, and convicted, but in
compassion to his family his punishment
was suspended; but a <i>Noli prosequi</i>
was never granted.</p>

<p>The aim of the <i>Free Briton</i>, in this
paper, is to shew the inconclusive
reasoning of the <i>Craftsman</i> from matters
of fact <i>falsely</i> asserted.</p>

<h3><span class="blackletter">Free Briton</span>, <i>Jan. 14.</i> No. 59.</h3>

<p>In the conclusion of this paper is a
letter by way of reply to the
<i>Craftsman</i>, Jan. 9. wherein that author
calls upon the <i>Free Briton</i> to justify
the administration for breaking with
the Emperor. To which the <i>Free
Briton</i> answers, that it will be full time
to make a defence when such measures
are undertaken; that their insolence
is astonishing, in imputing the
same crimes to our ministers for
which themselves have deserved a
halter. Asks the <i>Craftsman</i> whether
he imagines the ministry are so fond
of the Emperor on the sudden, as to
sacrifice the trade of <i>Spain</i>, and abandon
all the powers of <i>Europe</i>, only to
run into his arms?</p>

<p>In <i>Feb.</i> last an outcry was rais’d on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
a pretended discovery that the ministry
were making up at <i>Vienna</i> by an
implicit guarantee of the Emperor’s
succession to the <i>Austrian Netherlands</i>,
as he should settle it; yet this could
not be obtain’d of the <i>British</i> councils;
and now we are told we are ready
to lurch all our allies for his sake.</p>

<p>The authors of the <i>Craftsman</i> allow
that this Treaty-breaking measure
would be right, provided a certain
great man was removed. As if national
compacts could be dissolv’d by
the change of the ministers: The nation
must answer for the faith of
treaties. Grants that such a conduct
might be expected, should this ministry
be chang’d.</p>

<p>It does not redound to the shame of
those who made the treaty of <i>Seville</i>,
that the parties have allow’d the Emperor
a reasonable time to come into
their measures; which if they had not,
they would have been charg’d with
rashness, precipitation, and every enormity.
Concludes with mentioning
several injuries and insults that this
nation has suffer’d from the Imperial
quarter.</p>

<h3><span class="blackletter">Free Briton</span>, <i>Jan. 21.</i></h3>

<p>He applies <i>Job</i>’s saying to his
friends, <i>Will you lye for God?</i>
to the Craftsman, <i>Will you lye for liberty
and country?</i> and asks, if he demands
impunity for defamatory falsehood?</p>

<p>Breach of faith, which the <i>Craftsman</i>
had laid to the charge of the
ministry, is the most virulent aspersion
that a libeller can utter against
any government, is therefore
punishable, and declares his opinion,
that spreading false news is no part
of the freedom of the press.</p>

<p>He thinks no honest cause wants
the assistance of falshood, so no man
should lay claim to liberty who adheres
not to truth; therefore the
<i>Craftsman</i> ought not to complain of
severity from the government, unless
he will evince the truth of his
assertion.</p>

<p>Men think that prosecutions and
confinement are very hard, not considering
the provocations that urg’d
them; and that the worst imputations
are charg’d on the councils of
the crown, without the least colour of
truth. The punishment inflicted on
a libelling printer, bears no proportion
with the wrongs thus offer’d to a
great people.</p>

<p>Distinguishes between <i>opinions</i> offr’d
upon national affairs, and <i>misrepresentations</i>
of those affairs. The
first is not criminal, the other may.
Says, these men may be punished
on the Statute, as spreaders of false
news.</p>

<p>The <i>Craftsman</i> can defend himself
no other way then by refuting
the charge of falshood.</p>

<p>The <i>Craftsman</i> had suggested that
the <i>Government</i> abetted the very
practices for which he is under prosecution;
and instanced in the pamphlet
<i>Sedition and Defamation display’d</i>,
which represents the conduct and
characters of two persons who have
laboured these five years to make
this ministry odious, for which reasons
the opposite writers spare no
invectives to point out these gentlemen
<i>Weekly</i>, as <i>Traitors</i> and <i>Villains</i>.
The <i>Free Briton</i> here justifies the characters
complain’d of.</p>

<h3><span class="blackletter">Free Briton</span>, <i>Jan. 28.</i> No. 61.</h3>

<p>He takes notice that the <i>Craftsman</i>
in his reply to the pamphlet called
<i>Sedition and Defamation display’d</i>,
has not once attempted to show that
the characters of two gentlemen there
given are in the least unlike or injurious,
and maintains that whatever is
said of them in that pamphlet is indisputably
true; yet observes, that the
author admitted, that he who had
<i>wronged</i> his friendship, and <i>betrayed</i>
his confidence, came into the world
with <i>all the advantages</i> that recommend
men to the <i>esteem, favour, and
approbation of mankind</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Craftsman</i> on the contrary divests
the minister whose character he
draws of all those <i>talents</i> and <i>abilities</i>,
without which, <i>power</i> is not <i>easily acquir’d</i>,
or <i>long maintain’d</i>. See p. 4.</p>

<p>But the <i>minister’s abilities</i> have been
the dread and disappointment of his
enemies, and have carried him thro’
innumerable difficulties for five years
together, and enabled him to baffle
all their attempts against him; notwithstanding
he is describ’d as setting
out in mean circumstances, and recommended
to mankind by every bad quality,
yet those who object this now,
were more than ten years his associates
in <i>private life</i> as well as <i>publick affairs</i>.
As to what has been said of his being
<i>superior in impudence to all</i>, this author
replies, that ’twas never heard that
he call’d gentlemen <i>scoundrels</i> in <i>publick
assemblies</i>; reviled the <i>Speeches</i> from
the <i>Throne</i>; or, that if affairs were
managed as he dictated, he would
maintain his Majesty’s administration.</p>

<p>Several other scurrilous reflections,
thrown out against this honourable
person, are answer’d at large in this
paper, and some of them charged with
notorious falshood.</p>

<h3>The <span class="blackletter">British Journal</span>: or, The
<span class="blackletter">Traveller</span>, <i>Jan. 9.</i></h3>

<p>The author mentions two evils
which attend those that trade
with pawnbrokers; the first is, persons
who have left pledges in their hands,
upon offering to redeem them, have
been obliged to advance five or six
shillings more than they borrow’d on
them. The other is the power of the
pawnbroker to defraud his customer
entirely of his pledge; both which
may be redress’d by obliging pawnbrokers
to give a receipt to every person
borrowing money on pledges, to
which both borrower and lender shall
subscribe their names, and each of
them take a copy.</p>

<p>In some considerations on the stage,
opera’s, and the force of musick, he
says, that an opera ought to be as
regularly conducted, and the characters
as justly maintain’d; the same
end propos’d, and as large room for
the exercise of a fine genius, as in tragedy
or comedy. That a compleat
opera set to musick would have an
advantage over tragedy. Is not pleased
with the <i>Recitativo</i> of an opera, because
’tis the musick of the songs
only that dwell on the memory.</p>

<p>Distinguishes between the grand-opera
and those ballad-opera’s now
in vogue, which latter, if well set to
musick, might deserve applause.</p>

<p>Commends <i>Addison</i>’s <i>Rosamond</i> as a
beautifull piece of poetry, both in fable
and language. In it is maintain’d
the dignity of tragedy, the humour
of comedy, and the principal end of
opera’s; <i>i. e.</i> the encouragement of
virtue, discouraging vice, and probability
through the whole is preserv’d.</p>

<h3>The <span class="blackletter">British Journal</span>, <i>Jan. 23.</i></h3>

<p>Relates the history of two traytors,
<i>Edric</i> the father, and <i>Edric</i>
the son, who lived near 800 years ago;
from which he collects and concludes
with this lesson to princes,
that they ought to be cautious whom
they trust, and to pry with piercing
eyes into the conduct of their ministers,
and the motives of their counsels.</p>


<h3><i>An Extract of a Discourse made to the
<span class="antiqua">Royal Society</span>, in Defence of Mr.
<span class="antiqua">Cheselden</span>’s intended Operation on the
Ear of a condemn’d Malefactor.</i><br />
<span class="blackletter">Daily Courant.</span> <i>Jan. 17.</i></h3>

<p>The author first observes, that
the skin, commonly call’d, <i>The
Drum of the Ear</i>, is not the organ of
hearing, as was vulgarly thought;
for the proof of which he offers a
great number of reasons and observations
of his own, as well as the
opinions and reasons of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
learned and judicious anatomists.
He then observes, there are two passages
to the organs of hearing; one
by the outward ear, the other thro’
the back part of the mouth, thro’
which some people can hear, who
cannot hear thro’ the outward ear.
In this case he supposes the sound
may be interrupted by the drum of
the ear, which is seated in this passage,
and being diseased, may hinder
sounds from passing to the internal
parts, where are seated the
proper organs of hearing: In this
case only, he supposes, that perforating
the drum may prove a remedy
for deafness, as depressing the
chrystalline humour of the eye (vulgarly
call’d couching a cataract) is
daily found to be a remedy for
blindness; and yet that operation
has been as indecently and ignorantly
ridicul’d as the experiment
of Mr. <i>Cheselden</i>’s; one writer against
that operation not scrupling to give
his book the following title, <i>A new
method of recovering the sight by putting
out the eye</i>. He also deserves, that
the scituation of the drum is such,
that the operation may be easily
made by a skilful person; and it
being a very thin skin, he presumes
it will not be very painful;
and if so, the person who is to undergo
the experiment will purchase
his life upon very easy terms: But
supposing it should be very painful;
(which ’tis hop’d it will not be) on
whom can the first experiment be so
fitly made, for the service of mankind,
as on one whose life is already
forfeited to the publick?</p>

<h3><i><span class="blackletter">Read’s</span> Weekly Journal</i>, Jan. 16.</h3>

<p>Entertains his readers with a letter
from a correspondent concerning
the present state of the <i>Law</i>;
takes notice of the spleen which in general
appears against lawyer and law;
says, that the multiplicity of statutes
is one of the greatest grievances of this
kingdom. Quotes an opinion of a
learned judge, that the best way to reform
the law, was to abrogate all the
acts made for its amendment. Asserts,
that the founding a proper <i>Corpus Juris</i>,
is the highest point of policy in a well
order’d state. The old <i>English</i> method
of proceeding against debtors, being
judg’d inconvenient, produced the act
on which was found’d the <i>Capias in detinue</i>,
as the shortest way of recovery.
Complains of fictitious suits, particularly
in ejectments. He resents likewise
the encouragement given in every
court to the multitude of suitors, as
contrary to the very ends of justice.
Proposes some remedies for these evils,
by an act empowering commissioners
to inspect into</p>

<p>1. <i>The condition of the law in general,
common and statute; what of them
may be repealed, and what not.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>To frame proper instructions to direct
those who are intrusted with the execution
of the law.</i></p>

<p>3. <i>To examine into the nature of actions
on the case, which by judge <span class="antiqua">Dodderidge</span>
is declared to be a feigned action
contrived in deceit of the law.</i></p>

<p>4. <i>To contrive how to prevent vexatious
and litigious suits, by lessening the
credit of parole agreement.</i></p>

<p>5. <i>That every practiser of the law be
obliged by oath to give his opinion justly
to the best of his knowledge, to practise
fairly, and by no indirect means procure
false judgment in any case.</i></p>

<p>Lastly, <i>To compile a compleat body
of the law, with an institute of maxims
and rules, a treatise of practice,
and the forms to be observed by courts.</i></p>

<p>See more concerning the amending
the law, <i>p.</i> 77. 98. 100. 106. and

Sessions of Parliament relating there
to p. 213.</p>

<p>SIR,</p>

<p>As you are an impartial Writer, I
dare say you will do justice on both
sides.</p>

<p>The Verses on the <i>Laureat</i>, in yours
of <i>Saturday</i> last, have occasion’d the
following reply; which I hope you
will give a Place to in your next, to
show that we can be quick as well as
smart, upon a proper occasion. And
as I think it the lowest mark of a
scoundrel to make bold with any man’s
character in print, without subscribing
the true name of the author; I
therefore desire, if the <i>Laureat</i> is concern’d
enough to ask the question, that
you will tell him my name, and where
I live, till then I beg leave to be known
by no other than that of your servant,</p>

amidst so many celebrated
Poets, herself not
less deserving to be celebrated;
for whene’er she
trod the stage, her actions
always illustrated and ennobled
their compositions.
Never was one Genius so
adapted to the most different
parts; she seem’d not
made but born for each
distinctly. In tragedy
her noble presence, elevated
speech, and majestic
step, temper’d with so peculiar
a sweetness of voice,
never fail’d to transport
the most rustic and insensible
into admiration. In
comedy she discover’d such a winning air, such a sprightly and becoming gayety,
and so happy an address, that neither eyes were satisfied with seeing her, nor
hands weary of applauding.</i></p>

to the old statute of 33 <i>H.</i> VIII.</p>

<p>It may be some sort of amusement
to present our readers with the following
list of officers established in
the most notorious gaming-houses.</p>

him and two others of the proprietors.</p>

<p>2. A <i>Director</i>, who superintends
the Room.</p>

<p>3. An <i>Operator</i>, who deals the
cards at a cheating game called <i>Faro</i>.</p>

<p>4. Two <i>Crowpees</i>, who watch the
cards, and gather the money for
the Bank.</p>

<p>5. Two <i>Puffs</i>, who have money
given them to decoy others to play.</p>

<p>6. A <i>Clerk</i>, who is a check upon
the puffs, to see that they sink none
of the money that is given them to
play with.</p>

<p>7. A <i>Squib</i>, is a puff of a lower
rank, who serves at half salary,
while he is learning to deal.</p>

<p>8. A <i>Flasher</i>, to swear how often
the bank has been stript.</p>

<p>9. A <i>Dunner</i>, who goes about to
recover money lost at play.</p>

<p>10. A <i>Waiter</i>, to fill out wine,
snuff candles, and attend the gaming-room.</p>

<p>11. An <i>Attorney</i>, a <i>Newgate</i> solicitor.</p>

<p>12. A <i>Captain</i>, who is to fight any
gentleman that is peevish for losing
his money.</p>

<p>13. An <i>Usher</i>, who lights gentlemen
up and down stairs, and gives
the word to the Porter.</p>

<p>14. A <i>Porter</i>, who is generally a
soldier of the foot guards.</p>

<p>15. An <i>Orderly man</i>, who walks
up and down the outside of the door,

<h2><i>Domestick Occurences in <span class="antiqua">JANUARY, 1731</span>.</i></h2>

<h3>Melancholy Effects of Credulity in<br />
<span class="blackletter">Witchcraft</span>.</h3>

<p>For <i>Burlington</i> in <i>Pensilvania</i> we
have an account, that the owners of
several Cattle believing them to be
bewitch’d, caused some suspected
men and women to be taken up, and
trials to be made for detecting them.
Above 300 people assembled near
the governor’s house, and a pair of
scales being erected, the suspected
persons were each weigh’d against
a large Bible; but all of them vastly
outweighing it, the accused were
then to be tied head and feet together,
and put into a river, on supposition
that if they swam they must
be guilty. This trial they offer’d
to undergo, in case as many of their
accusers should be served in the like
manner; which being done, they all
swam very buoyant, to the no small
diversion of the spectators, and clearing
of the accused.&mdash;This has revived
a like transaction in <i>Somersetshire</i>
in <i>Sept.</i> last, and another in <i>France</i>.</p>

<p>The first is from <i>Frome</i> publish’d
in the <i>Daily Journal</i>, <i>Jan. 15.</i> relating,
That a child of one <i>Wheeler</i> being
seized with strange unaccountable
fits, the mother goes to a <i>Cunning
Man</i>, who advis’d her to hang
a bottle of the child’s water, mix’d
with some of it’s hair, close stopt
over the fire, that the witch would
thereupon come and break it: Does
not mention the success, but a poor
old woman, in the neighbourhood,
was taken up, and the old trial by
<i>Water Ordeal</i> reviv’d. They dragg’d
her, shivering with an ague, out of
her house, set her astride on the pomel
of a saddle, and carried her about
two miles to a mill-pond, stript
off her upper cloaths, tied her legs,
and with a rope about her middle
threw her in, 200 spectators huzza-ing
and abetting the riot. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
affirm she swam like a cork, tho’
forced several times under water;
and no wonder, for when they strained
the line, the ends whereof were
held on each side of the pond, she
must of necessity rise; but by haling
her from one bank to t’other, and
often plunging, she drank water enough,
and when almost spent, they
poured in brandy to revive her,
they drew her to a stable, threw her
on some litter in her wet cloaths,
where in about an hour after she
expired. The coroner upon his
Inquest cou’d make no discovery
of the ring-leaders, altho’ above 40
Persons assisted in the Fact, yet
none of them could be persuaded
to accuse his Neighbour: so that
they were able to charge only 3 of
them with Man-slaughter.</p>

<p>The like Credulity in witchcraft
occasion’d a tragical Accident at a
Village near <i>Mortagne</i> in <i>France</i>, in
<i>December</i> last. A Man of that Village
had been long ill of a Distemper
which puzzled the Physicians;
whereupon his Wife believ’d he was
bewitch’d, and consulted a pretended
Conjurer, who shew’d her the
Wizard (her husband’s uncle) in a
glass of Water, and told her, that
to oblige him to withdraw the
Charm, they must beat him, and
burn the Soles of his Feet. On her
Return she sent for the Uncle, and
notwithstanding his Protestations,
with the Assistance of her Relations,
beat him unmercifully, and burnt
the Soles of his Feet, and the Crown
of his Head in such a manner, that
in two Days after he died. The
Woman and her Accomplices were
seized; she own’d the Fact, and
said, if it was to do again, she
would do it. <i>See</i> p. 358.</p>

<h3><span class="blackletter">Extraordinary Accidents</span>,
and <span class="blackletter">Casualties</span>.</h3>

<p>A barbarous Murder was committed
the 4th Inst. at Night, on <i>John
Williams</i> Carpenter of <i>Cumback</i> in
<i>Radnorshire</i>, by stabbing him in the
Throat with a Knife, and beating
out his Brains with an Ax: His
Door being left latch’d, and the
Key in the thatch as usual, and no
Robbery committed. It was not
discover’d till the 7th, when his only
Brother <i>William</i> came, and in
the presence of abundance of Neighbours,
owned the bloody Knife,
which together with the washing
of his bloody Cloaths by his sweetheart
the Night the Murder was
committed, and no body to get by
his Brother’s death but himself,
caus’d him to be apprehended, and
sent to <i>Presteign</i> Goal; and his
Sweetheart was bound to appear against
him. <i>See</i> p. 178.</p>

<p>From <i>Dijon</i> in France, ’tis written,
that a Person having withdrawn
himself, his Relations charg’d one
who was his sworn Enemy with his
murder, and examin’d him with such
exquisite tortures, that, to shorten
them he confess’d the crime: whereupon
he was broke alive, and two
others as his accomplices were hanged.
The Man suppos’d to be murder’d,
soon after return’d home.</p>

<p><i>Brussels 25.</i> O. S. About 2 o’Clock
this morning, a dreadful fire broke
out in the Arch Dutchess’s palace,
which with the goods and furniture,
and Royal Chapel were laid in ashes
in less than 12 hours. The Arch-Dutchess
and her ladies only escap’d,
almost all the Papers and
Records of State being consum’d.</p>

<p><i>Bourdeaux, Jan. 24.</i> N. S. Forty
monks dy’d here in one Night; upon
enquiry to discover the cause, a
dead Viper was found in a Cask of
Wine they had regal’d themselves
with, suppos’d to have come in at
the bung-hole.</p>

<p><i>Morlaix</i>, in lower <i>Bretagne</i>, <i>Jan.
11.</i> N. S. By a fire which broke out
in the hospital, the whole town was
burnt down; the People were reduc’d
to the greatest hardships.</p>

<p>Several nuns have dy’d suddenly
at <i>Englen</i>, five leagues from <i>Brussels</i>,
their Bodies were open’d, but no
marks of Contagion or Poison appearing,
some weak People believed
it must be by witchcraft, but they
could not tell whom to accuse. However,
the surviving sisters quitted the
Cloysters, and with the Bp.’s consent
return’d to their Friends.</p>

<p>One <i>William Sutor</i>, Aged about

(belonging to the Laird of <i>Balgown</i>

own house, over-heard at some distance,
as it were, an uncommon
skreeking and noise; and they following
the Voice, fancied they saw
a dark gray-colour’d Dog; but as it
was dark night, they concluded it
was a Fox, and accordingly were
for setting on their Dogs: but it
was very observeable, that not one
of them would so much as point
his Head that way.</p>

<p>About a month after, the said <i>Sutor</i>
being occasionally in the same
spot, and much about the same time
of Night, it appear’d to him again,
and in passing, touched him so
smartly on the Thigh, that he felt
a pain all that Night.</p>

<p>In <i>December</i> 1729, it again cast up
to him at about the same place, and
past him at some distance.</p>

<p>In <i>June</i> 1730, it appeared to him
as formerly: And it was now he
began to judge it was something
extraordinary.</p>

<p>On the last <i>Monday</i> of <i>Nov.</i> 1730,
about sky-setting, as he was coming
from <i>Drumlochy</i>, this officious visiter
passed him as formerly, and in
passing, he distinctly heard it speak
these words, <i>Within eight or ten days
do or die</i>; and instantly disappear’d,
leaving him not a little perplex’d.</p>

<p>Next morning he came to his
brother <i>James</i>’s house, and gave
him a particular account of all that
had happen’d: And that night, about
10 of the clock, these two brothers
having been visiting their sister
at <i>Glanballow</i>, and returning
home, stept aside to see the remarkable
spot, where they had no sooner
arriv’d, then it appear’d to <i>William</i>,
who pointing his finger to it, desired
his brother and a servant who
was with them, to look to it; but
neither of them could see any such
thing.</p>

<p>Next <i>Saturday</i> evening, as <i>William</i>
was at his sheep-fold, it came up to
him, and audibly utter’d these
Words <i>Come to the spot of ground within,
half an hour</i>. Whereupon he
went home, and taking a Sword and
a staff in his hand, came to the
ground, being at last determined to
see the Issue. He had scarce encircled
himself with a line of circumvallarion,
when his troublesome familiar
came up to him, he ask’d it,
<i>In the name of God, who are you?</i> It
answer’d, <i>I am David Sutor, George
Sutor’s Brother: I killed a Man, more
than 35 years ago, at a bush by East
the road as you go into the Isle</i>. He
said to it, <i>David Sutor was a Man,
and you appear as a Dog</i>. It answer’d,
<i>I killed him with a Dog, and am made
to speak out of the mouth of a Dog: and
I tell you to go bury these Bones</i>.</p>

<p>This coming to the ears of the
<i>Minister</i> of <i>Blair</i>, the Lairds of
<i>Glascloon</i> and <i>Rychalzie</i>, &amp;c. about 40
Men, went together to the said Isle;
but after opening ground in several
places, found no Bones.</p>

<p>On the 23d of <i>Decemb.</i> about midnight,
when <i>William</i> was in bed,
it came to his door, and said, <i>Come
away: you will find the bones at the side
of the wither’d Bush, and there are but
8 left</i>; and told him at the same
time for a sign, that he would find
the print of a Cross impress’d on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the Ground.</p>

<p>Next day <i>William</i> and his brother,
with about 40 or 50 people who had
conveen’d out of curiosity, came to
the place, where they discover’d the
bush, and the cross by it; and upon
digging the ground about a foot
down found the eight bones: All
which they immediately wrapt in
clean linen, and being put in a
coffin with a mort-cloth over it,
were interr’d that evening in the
church-yard of <i>Blair</i>, attended by
about 100 Persons.</p>

<p>N. B. <i>Several People in that Country
remember to have seen this <span class="antiqua">David Sutor</span>;
and that he listed for a Soldier, and
went abroad about 34 or 35 years ago.</i></p>

<h2>Remarkable <i>ADVERTISEMENTS</i>.</h2>

<p>In the <i>Gazette</i>, <i>Jan. 30.</i> ’tis advertis’d,
that in <i>July 1729</i>, at <i>Bentworth</i>
in the County of <i>Southampton</i>,
a barn was set on fire, and the corn
and grain therein, the Stables and
out houses adjoining were entirely
burnt. Several messuages in the said
parish have since been confirmed in
the same manner, and <i>Bentworth</i>, it
self threatned to be laid in ashes;
his Majesty’s pardon is promised to
any one that would discover his
Accomplice.</p>

<p>In the <i>Gazette</i> of the same date,
’tis advertis’d, that the widows of
such half-pay Officers as serv’d, and
to whom they were marry’d in the
year 1716, may receive their proportions
of the sum of 1500 <i>l.</i> granted
the last Sessions of Parliament for
that purpose.</p>

<p><i>London Evening Post</i>, <i>Jan. 28th.</i> ’tis
advertis’d from <i>Whitehaven</i>, that a
vessel sailed for <i>London</i>, laden with
the late Mr. <i>Wood</i>’s ore, coals, cinders,
and lime-stone, to be carried to
<i>Chelsea</i>, to give a Specimen that iron
is to be made from the ore and pit-coal.
A reason is demanded why
<i>Chelsea</i>, that produces neither, is a
better place to make iron, than the
neighbourhood of <i>Whitehaven</i>, where
there is plenty of both, unless there
was design of imposing upon the
World?</p>

<p>Any poor person may be cured of
the <i>Ague</i> gratis, by a dose only, which
may be contained in a gill-glass, and
never known to fail. To be had of
Mr. <i>Sam. Tripland</i>, at the <i>Coach-maker’s
Arms</i> in <i>Great-windmill-street</i>,
over-against the <i>Hay-market</i>.</p>

<p>Letters patent were granted to
Mr. <i>G. Kettle</i> of <i>Southwark</i>, for making
and dying of hats and ruffs of
different colours, except black.</p>

<h2><i>Foreign Affairs.</i></h2>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-w.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">We think it a proper introduction
to the history of
the year newly begun, to
give our readers a transient
view of the situation
of Affairs at the conclusion of the
last; and as we find this ready done
to our hands in the <i>Post-Boy</i>, <i>Dec. 31.</i>
we shall make no apology for epitomizing
his essay upon that Subject.</p>

<p>The Clouds in which the fate of
<i>Europe</i> was obscur’d at the close of
the Year 1729, are not yet dissipated,
notwithstanding the efforts of politicians,
the number of Negotiations,
and the union of four of the most
formidable powers in <i>Europe</i>, by the
Treaty of <i>Seville</i>.</p>

<p>The allies of <i>Seville</i> now see in what
advantageous situation the treaty of
<i>Utrecht</i> has put the Emperor in <i>Italy</i>.
We find, that the Empire, which in the
reign of <i>Leopold</i>, could not send 20,000
men to the <i>Rhine</i> or <i>Flanders</i>, without
subsidies from <i>England</i> or <i>Holland</i>, can
send 20,000 men to <i>Italy</i>, and maintain
them there without assistance, its
revenue amounting to no less than
15 millions of <i>Florins</i> a year. She
now employs her Powers to baffle
the projects of those who rais’d her
to this grandeur: Projects whose
only drift is the Execution of a
treaty, wherein the Imperial court
is one of the principal parties contracting,
which treaty was made
with two views. The first was an
addition to the power of the Emperor
in <i>Italy</i>, by bringing under her obedience
the two <i>Sicilies</i>. The second
chear’d up <i>Spain</i> for the losses she had
sustain’d, particularly in the fine branches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
lopt from that crown, by securing
to one of her <i>Infantes</i> the uncertain
hope of two successions.</p>

<p>The catholick King and his allies do
not undertake or ask anything that
the Imperial court has just reason to
complain of.</p>

<p>The reasons alledg’d by the Imperialists
for their complaints are, that an
alteration had been made in one single
article of the quadruple alliance, which
set forth the <i>manner</i> of securing to the
<i>Infante</i> of <i>Spain</i> the eventual succession
which had been promis’d him. But,</p>

<p>1. This alteration is of no great importance,
because the 6000 <i>neutral</i>
troops which by the treaty of <i>London</i>
were to be garrison’d in <i>Tuscany</i> and
<i>Parma</i>, by the treaty of <i>Seville</i> are only
turn’d into <i>Spaniards</i>, which are in
some sort made neutral by being discharg’d
from the oath to their sovereign,
and made to take an oath to the
Great Duke, and Duke of <i>Parma</i>.</p>

<p>2. This alteration does not prejudice
to the Emperor, or threaten him with
any hereafter, because his strict and
religious observation of treaties will
not suffer him to oppose the <i>Infante</i>’s
promis’d succession; nor will the <i>bona
fide</i> of the king of <i>Spain</i> let him employ
his 6000 <i>Spaniards</i> on any design
but what is stipulated by the treaty of
<i>Seville</i>.</p>

<p>3. This alteration was not made
without substantial reasons. The Imperialists
always opposed the motion
for putting <i>Spaniards</i> in garrison in
the towns of <i>Tuscany</i> and <i>Parma</i>; and
were averse even to the admission of
neutral troops; upon which the allies
passed the 4th article of the treaty of
<i>Seville</i>.</p>

<p>This article was the subject of the
late Negotiations. The resolution of
the Imperial court to admit of no deviation
from the treaty of Quadruple
alliance; and that of the court of <i>Spain</i>
never to consent to any alteration in
the treaty of <i>Seville</i>, occasion’d the
preparations for war all the last summer,
but ended in preparations offensive
and defensive, and were kept from
breaking into action by the thread of
negotiation; and the opening of this
scene is reserved for the year we are
now entering upon; <i>but hitherto Things
remain in the same situation</i>, Jan. 30.</p>

<p><i>Constantinople.</i> Since the great revolution
made here by the Janizaries
in cutting to pieces the late Vizier,
<i>Capigi Aga</i>, Capt. <i>Bashaw</i>, and
<i>Mufti</i>, &amp;c., and afterwards deposing
Sultan <i>Achmet</i>, and raising the new
Sultan (whose father was depos’d in
1703) to the throne; there has been
no settled government. For upon
divers pretences these tumultuous
rebels were frequently up in arms,
demanding several new regulations;
particularly the promoting of their
favourites, and the removal or death
of those who were obnoxious to ’em.
All which was comply’d with in
order to appease them: But this
procedure not satisfying them, and
they still continuing mutinous, the
Grand Segnior under pretence of
holding a general council, got the
chief of ’em into his palace, cut ’em
all off with their servants; and about
7000 of their followers were
strangled, to the great joy of this
city; these rebellious people grew
so insolent, as to tax families what
sums they pleas’d, and even to
plunder in the street: But now every
thing is reduc’d to the old <i>Ottoman</i>
rules of government.</p>

<p><i>Moscow, Jan. 8.</i> Advices from Derbent
say, that the princes of Georgia
passed that place, in their way home
much pleased with the honours they
have received from this court, and
that one of them, who lives near
mount Arrarat, had promis’d to send
the Empress a relique of <i>Noah’s Ark</i>.</p>

<p><i>Venice.</i> ’Tis currently reported
that this republick will equip a
squadron of twenty Ships of war, to
put to sea early next spring, to watch
the motions of the Turks.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Vienna, Jan. 20.</i> Our hopes of
an accommodation with <i>Spain</i> encrease
daily.</p>

<p><i>Paris.</i> New proposals of accommodation
are negotiating with <i>Spain</i>
and the Emperor; and ’tis thought
with a fair prospect of success.</p>

<p><i>Swisserland, Bern.</i> Provision is making
in all the protestant cantons
for the reception of a great number
of Waldenses, who are depriv’d of
their liberties and drove from their
habitations, by their sovereign the
duke of <i>Savoy</i>.</p>

<p><i>Vienna.</i> There are privately handed
about here copies of the <i>Ultimatum</i>
(or last proposals) of the allies
of <i>Seville</i>, as transmitted hither from
<i>Paris</i>; the substance of which is as
follows.</p>

<p>1. <i>They would stipulate by a secret
article not to oppose the settlement of Succession
which the <span class="antiqua">Emperor</span> might make
for his Territories in <span class="antiqua">Italy</span>, and which
should be freely accepted by the States
thereof; and they would engage to guaranty
that Settlement.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>They would stipulate by a secret
article, that they would not oppose the
advantages of Succession, which the <span class="antiqua">Emperor</span>,
with the consent of the different
States of <span class="antiqua">Italy</span>, might procure in favour
of the archdutchess his daughter; and
contribute to maintain what he shall so
establish for his daughters, or for any
one he shall pitch upon, with regard to
his Territories in <span class="antiqua">Italy</span>; and even to
guaranty what may be established by the
<span class="antiqua">Emperor</span> in consequence of that Settlement.</i></p>

<p><i>Seville, Jan. 16.</i> Couriers are continually
arriving upon the heels of
one another, which occasion frequent
councils.</p>

<p><i>Hague.</i> About the latter end of
this month their High Mightinesses
wrote a letter to the United Provinces,
for the celebration of the 28th
of <i>Feb.</i> as a day of solemn thanksgiving,
fasting and prayer, which imports
in substance, <i>That altho’ it has
pleas’d God, in his infinite patience and
clemency, that we have enjoy’d peace last
year, this peace was nevertheless attended
with so much uneasiness and difficulty,
in relation to the small success of the
negotiations set on foot for terminating
amicably the differences in <span class="antiqua">Europe</span>, and
establishing a general tranquillity, that
we are still in a very uncertain and difficult
scituation, and have great reason
to fear that a war may at last happen,
wherein this State may be engag’d, contrary
to its inclination: That our apprehension
in this respect increases so much
the more when we consider, that notwithstanding
all the blessings which it hath
pleased God to shower down upon our
dear Country, the sins and iniquities
thereof, far from diminishing, increase
daily, to such a degree, that last year
horrible, abominable sins appear’d, almost
unknown before in this Country; and
that we ought to fear, that the patience
of the Lord, justly provok’d, ceasing, his
Judgments may at last fall upon our
dear Country, unless we endeavour to
prevent them, by an unfeigned repentance
and conversion.</i></p>

<h2><i>Observations in <span class="smcap">Gardening</span> for the Month of <span class="antiqua">February</span>.</i></h2>

<p>This is a month of great work
for the gardener.</p>

<p>In the kitchen-garden renew the
heat of your hot-beds with fresh dung,
and continue to sow cucumbers and
melons as in the former month.</p>

<p>Make a large hot-bed for forward
rhadishes and spring carrots; they
may be sown together, because the
rhadishes be drawn in <i>March</i>, whereby
they will make room for the carrots.
The bed must be cover’d with
earth 7 or 8 inches thick, and defended
with mats, supported with
hoops.</p>

<p>Make a hot-bed for <i>Battersey</i> kidney-beans,
and all sorts of annuals,
except <i>African</i> and <i>French</i> marigold,
which may be deferr’d 10 or 20 days.
About the middle of the month, upon
a declining hot-bed sow colly-flower
seeds; also in the natural ground
pease, beans, parsley, spinach, carrots,
parsnips, turnips, onions, leeks,
<i>Dutch</i> brown lettuce, and asparagus-seeds.</p>

<p>Sow skerrits in light rich ground,
where they may have moisture.</p>

<p>Plant garlick, shalots, and rockambole,
for increase, in light ground.</p>

<p>Transplant young cabbage-plants
for a crop.</p>

<p>Make plantations of straw-berries,
rasberries, goose-berries, currants,
and roses.</p>

<p>Elm-setts should now be gather’d
from the roots of large trees, and
planted in nursery-beds, and young
plantations should be now provided
with all sorts of forest-trees and shrubs,
which are propagated from slips or
layers.</p>

<p>Set acorns of the <i>Ilex</i>, cork-tree,
<i>English</i> oak, chestnuts, and walnuts.</p>

<p>Sow the sameria of the elm, and
bay berries, all which come up the
first year.</p>

<p>Lay branches of several trees to
take root. This is the best time to
raise any thing that will grow of slips.</p>

<p>Prune fruit-trees and vines; for now
is your season to bind, plash, nail, and
dress, without danger of frosts. This
is to be understood of the most tender
and delicate wall-fruits not finish’d
before: do this before the buds and
bearers grow turgid; and yet in the
nectarine and like delicate mural
fruit, the later the better, notwithstanding
what has been, and still is
the contrary custom.</p>

<p>The latter end of this month is
most proper to graft pears and plums
of all sorts; and some likewise graft
apples and cherries in the cleft, tho’
others defer apples longer. The cyons
cut off from the trees last month, are
now to be used, without having any
regard to the notion of the age of
the moon.</p>

<p>Now, as well as in <i>October</i>, may be
planted the espaliers of pears, plums,
or apples, so useful as well as profitable
in a garden; for being planted a
convenient distance from a fruit wall,
they are an admirable defence against
blighting winds, and produce noble
fruit.</p>

<p>Rub moss from trees after a shower
of rain; scrape and cleanse them
from cankers, <i>&amp;c.</i> Cut and lay quick-sets,
and trim up palasade hedges.</p>

<p>Earth up the roots of uncover’d
fruit-trees, and drain superfluous moisture
from roots of trees. Lay bird-lime
for the bird called the tit, or
tit-mouse, which is a destructive enemy
to dwarf pears and plums in this
and the preceding month, by destroying
the buds.</p>

<p>The beginning of this month you
may sow auricula seeds in cases fill’d
with light earth, and the seeds of the
polyanthois in some shady border.</p>

<p>Transplant all sorts of flowering
shrubs, which bear the weather; as
roses, jessamine, hony-suckle, laburnum,
lelac, syringa, spipeas, altheas, <i>&amp;c.</i>
You may make layers of roses, pomegranates,
phillyrea, laurus-tinus, and
other shrubs.</p>

<p>Cut the <i>Spanish</i> jessamine within 4
inches of the stem, giving them fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
earth, likewise give fresh earth to
your carnations planted out in <i>Autumn</i>.
Towards the latter end sow lark-spurs,
hollyhocks, <i>Canterbury</i> bells, primrose-tree,
sweet-williams, annual stocks,
candy-tufts, pinks, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>Make plantations of the lilly of the
valley on the side of some shady bank.
Sow orange and lemon kernels in pots;
set the pots in hot-beds; the kernels
are to be used as soon as taken out of
the fruit. Shift such myrtles as require
large pots, at the same time
shaving off the outside fibres of their
root, and if there be occasion, prune
their heads pretty close. Turn and
skreen Mould for the use of next
month, and continue to roll gravel-walks
after rain and frost.</p>

<p><i>It has been unexceptionably advanced, that a good <span class="antiqua">Abridgment</span>
of the Law is more intelligible than the Statutes at large; so a
nice <span class="antiqua">Model</span> is as entertaining as the <span class="antiqua">Original</span>, and a true
<span class="antiqua">Specimen</span> as satisfactory as the whole <span class="antiqua">Parcel</span>: This may serve to
illustrate the Reasonableness of our present Undertaking, which in
the <span class="antiqua">first</span> place is to give Monthly a View of all the Pieces of
Wit, <span class="antiqua">Humour</span>, or Intelligence, daily offer’d to the Publick in the
News-Papers, (which of late are so multiply’d, as to render it impossible,
unless a man makes it a business, to consult them all) and in
the <span class="antiqua">next</span> place we shall join therewith some other matters of Use or
Amusement that will be communicated to us.</i></p>

<p><i>Upon calculating the Number of News-Papers, ’tis found that
(besides divers written Accounts) no less than 200 Half-sheets per
Month are thrown from the Press only in <span class="antiqua">London</span>, and about as
many printed elsewhere in the Three Kingdoms; a considerable Part
of which constantly exhibit Essays on various Subjects for Entertainment;
and all the rest, occasionally oblige their Readers
with matters of Public Concern, communicated to the World by
Persons of Capacity thro’ their Means: so that they are become the
chief Channels of Amusement and Intelligence. But then being only
loose Papers, uncertainly scatter’d about, it often happens, that many
things deserving Attention, contained in them, are only seen by Accident,
and others not sufficiently publish’d or preserved for universal
Benefit and Information.</i></p>

<p><i>This Consideration has induced several Gentlemen to promote a
Monthly Collection, to treasure up, as in a <span class="antiqua">Magazine</span>, the most
remarkable Pieces on the Subjects abovemention’d, or at least impartial
Abridgments thereof, as a Method much better calculated to
preserve those Things that are curious, than that of transcribing.</i></p>

<p><i>In pursuance whereof, and the great Encouragement already given,
this <span class="antiqua"><span class="smcap">Work</span></span> will be regularly continued, shall appear earlier, and
contain more than any other Monthly Book of the same Price.</i></p>

<p><i>As all possible Care will be taken to avoid the Mistakes incident
to undertakings of this kind, so the Author will think himself oblig’d
to such Persons who shall give him a true state of any Transaction
erroneously publish’d in the Papers, or shall please to communicate
any Pieces of Wit or Entertainment proper to be inserted; directing
for him at the Printer’s at St. <span class="antiqua">John</span>’s Gate, near <span class="antiqua">Hicks’s-Hall</span>,
where any Persons sending proper Orders, may have the Numbers
sent them, at their first coming out, without further Trouble, whether
in Town or Country.</i></p>

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
